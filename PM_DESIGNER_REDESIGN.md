# Bolt.new Enterprise - PM & Designer Focus Redesign

## Overview
Successfully redesigned the bolt.new enterprise landing page to target **Product Managers and Designers** instead of developers, as requested by your boss.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Messaging & Value Proposition**
- **Old**: "Build full-stack apps with AI in your browser"
- **New**: "Turn your ideas into working apps instantly"
- Removed all technical jargon (API keys, Node.js, WebContainers, etc.)
- Focused on business outcomes rather than technical features

### 2. **Hero Section**
- Emphasized "No coding required" prominently
- Changed benefits to focus on:
  - From idea to interactive prototype in minutes
  - Beautiful, responsive designs out of the box
  - Real-time collaboration with stakeholders
  - Export to production code when ready
- Updated social proof: "5,000+ PMs & designers" instead of "2,847 developers"

### 3. **Problem/Solution Section**
- **Old Problems**: Technical setup, CRUD operations, environment requirements
- **New Problems**: Waiting for dev resources, specs sitting in backlogs, lost in translation
- Solutions now focus on instant prototyping, same-day testing, real-time changes

### 4. **Product Demo Section**
Completely redesigned demos to be relevant for PMs/Designers:
- Marketing Landing Page creation
- Customer Dashboard design
- Mobile App Prototype building
- Removed technical details (React, Node.js) and replaced with visual outcomes
- Added visual indicators like "Pixel Perfect", "Responsive", "Deploy Ready"

### 5. **Features Section**
Replaced developer features with PM/Designer focused capabilities:
- Brand System Integration
- Team Collaboration
- Design Tool Sync (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD)
- Multi-platform Export
- Analytics & Testing

### 6. **Testimonials**
Created new testimonials from:
- Sarah Chen (VP of Product, Spotify)
- Michael Torres (Senior Product Manager, Airbnb)
- Emma Johnson (Head of Design, Notion)
All focusing on rapid prototyping, stakeholder buy-in, and productivity gains

### 7. **FAQ Section**
Completely rewrote FAQs to address PM/Designer concerns:
- "Do I need to know how to code?" (No!)
- "Can I use my existing design system?"
- "What happens when I need custom features?"
- Removed technical questions about LLMs and coding standards

### 8. **Visual Design Updates**
- Changed primary color scheme from blue to purple/pink gradient
- More design-focused icons (Palette, MousePointer2, Layers, Figma)
- Softer, more creative aesthetic throughout
- Maintained premium, enterprise feel

### 9. **CTAs & Forms**
- Changed "Request Demo" to "See it in action"
- Updated form to ask for "Team Size" instead of "Engineering Team Size"
- Changed final CTA from "Schedule Demo" to "Start Free Trial"
- Added "30-day free trial • No credit card required" messaging

### 10. **Trust Logos**
- Swapped developer-focused companies for design-forward brands
- Now featuring: Airbnb, Spotify, Uber, Pinterest, Slack, Notion, Figma

## Result
The landing page now speaks directly to Product Managers and Designers, emphasizing:
- **Speed**: Ship products 10× faster without waiting for developers
- **Simplicity**: No coding knowledge required
- **Collaboration**: Real-time changes and stakeholder buy-in
- **Quality**: Beautiful, production-ready outputs
- **Flexibility**: Works with existing design systems and tools

The page maintains enterprise credibility while being approachable for non-technical users. It focuses on business outcomes (faster shipping, more experiments, stakeholder satisfaction) rather than technical capabilities.
